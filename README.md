### Personalized Macronutrient Ratios Calculation:

**Details:**
- **Age:** 45 years old
- **Sex:** Male
- **Weight:** 120 kg
- **Activity Level:** Sedentary desk job
- **Goal:** Body fat reduction

**Step 1: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**  
Using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
\[ BMR = 10 \times \text{weight in kg} + 6.25 \times \text{height in cm} - 5 \times \text{age in years} + 5 \]
Assuming height is 187 cm:
\[ BMR = 10 \times 120 + 6.25 \times 187 - 5 \times 45 + 5 \]
\[ BMR = 1200 + 1168.75 - 225 + 5 \]
\[ BMR = 2148.75 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**  
\[ TDEE = BMR \times \text{Activity Factor} \]
For a sedentary desk job, the activity factor is 1.2:
\[ TDEE = 2148.75 \times 1.2 \]
\[ TDEE = 2578.5 \]

**Step 3: Determine Caloric Deficit**  
For fat loss, aim for a 500-calorie deficit:
\[ Target Calories = TDEE - 500 \]
\[ Target Calories = 2578.5 - 500 \]
\[ Target Calories = 2078.5 \]

**Step 4: Macronutrient Ratios**  
- **Protein:** 2.0 grams per kg of body weight (high end for muscle preservation during fat loss)
- **Fats:** 25% of total calories (moderate fat intake)
- **Carbohydrates:** Remaining calories from carbs

**Protein Calculation:**
\[ Protein = 2.0 \times 120 = 240 \text{ grams} \]
\[ Calories from Protein = 240 \times 4 = 960 \text{ calories} \]

**Fat Calculation:**
\[ Calories from Fat = 0.25 \times 2078.5 = 519.625 \text{ calories} \]
\[ Fat in grams = \frac{519.625}{9} \approx 58 \text{ grams} \]

**Carbohydrates Calculation:**
\[ Calories from Carbs = 2078.5 - (960 + 519.625) = 598.875 \text{ calories} \]
\[ Carbs in grams = \frac{598.875}{4} \approx 150 \text{ grams} \]

**Intermittent Fasting Integration:**
- Implement an 18/6 fasting schedule (18 hours fasting, 6 hours eating window).
- Schedule workouts towards the end of your fasting period or during your eating window for optimal energy levels.
- On fasting days with lower energy, focus on technique and form rather than maximal effort.

### **Nutrition Recommendations**
1. **Caloric Intake:**
   - Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and aim for a moderate caloric deficit of 300-500 calories per day.
   - Adjust calorie intake based on your progress and energy levels.

2. **Macronutrient Balance:**
   - Protein: 1.6-2.2 grams per kg of body weight (240 grams)
   - Carbohydrates: 40-50% of total calories (approximately 150 grams)
   - Fats: 20-30% of total calories (approximately 58 grams)

3. **Meal Timing:**
   - With 18/6 intermittent fasting, consume your meals within a 6-hour eating window.
   - Have a protein-rich meal shortly after your workouts.

4. **Food Choices:**
   - Lean proteins: Chicken, turkey, lean beef, fish, egg whites, Greek yogurt
   - Complex carbohydrates: Brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, oats
   - Healthy fats: Avocado, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish
   - Fruits and vegetables: Aim for a variety of colors to ensure diverse nutrient intake

5. **Hydration:**
   - Drink at least 3-4 liters of water per day, especially important during fasting periods

6. **Supplements:**
   - Whey protein: 20-30g post-workout
   - Creatine: 5g daily
   - Multivitamin: To fill any nutritional gaps
   - Fish oil: For omega-3 fatty acids

7. **Pre and Post-Workout Nutrition:**
   - Pre-workout (if within eating window): Complex carbs and lean protein
   - Post-workout: Protein shake or meal high in protein and carbs

8. **Fasting Day Considerations:**
   - Break your fast with a balanced meal containing protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats
   - Ensure you're meeting your daily caloric and macronutrient needs within the eating window

### **Active Recovery**
- **Stretching and Foam Rolling:** Post-workout and on rest days
- **Contrast Showers:** Alternate hot and cold water for improved circulation
- **Sleep and Stress Management:**
  - Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep
  - Engage in relaxation techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing

**Additional Tips:**
- Incorporate self-myofascial release techniques, like lacrosse ball or tennis ball rolling, to aid in muscle recovery.
- Prioritize sleep and stress management to support muscle growth and fat loss.

### **Additional Methods to Enhance Fat Loss**
- **Intermittent Fasting:** Follow the 18/6 method, fasting for 18 hours and eating during a 6-hour window.
- **EPOC:** Emphasize HIIT and strength training to increase post-exercise oxygen consumption.
- **Core and Abs Training:**
  - Planks
  - Side planks
  - Russian twists

**Additional Tips:**
- Incorporate more core and abs exercises, such as leg raises, bicycle crunches, or woodchoppers.
- Consider adding a morning cardio session on an empty stomach to boost fat loss.

### **Progress Tracking**
- **Weekly Weigh-ins and Measurements:** Track your progress and adjust your caloric intake and workout intensity as needed.
- **Photographic Evidence:** Take weekly progress photos to visually document changes.

**Additional Tips:**
- Take progress photos and measurements bi-weekly to monitor changes.
- Adjust your workout plan and nutrition as needed based on your progress.

### **What to Expect After 8 Weeks**
